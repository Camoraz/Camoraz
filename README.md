## Hi there 👋

I'm an AI and Mathematics student, who also has a deep interest in Computer Vision, Game Development and Language Learning! I'm also a fervent Linux user.

Here is a game I'm working on:
[Warlord Rhapsody](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3508280/Warlord_Rhapsody/)

I'm usually busy during the year, so development is on summer and winter holidays. Feel free to join the discord (link in the Steam page).

For any questions about the code, game or any other topic, feel free to contact me!
